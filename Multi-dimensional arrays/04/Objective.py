Today's journey takes us through the 
intricate paths within a 2-dimensional 
array, often likened to a game board. 
Our mission is to identify ideal spots for 
game piece placement. 
Sounds like an adventure, 
doesn't it? Let's embark!

Visualize a chessboard in the form of a 2D array, where each cell could be marked 'E' for empty or 'P' for a piece. Our quest involves summoning a Python function named find_positions(). Upon examining this 2D array, this function identifies all the spots where a new piece could be placed so that it can move to another empty cell in one move. The catch is that a piece can move only to an immediately neighboring cell directly above, below, to the left, or right, but not diagonally.

Consider this 4x4 board for instance:

Copy
P E E P
E P E P
P E P P
P E P E

The function should render an output as: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)]. 
This output represents the positions where a new piece can fit perfectly and then 
be able to move in the next turn.

Stepping right into action, we start with an empty positions list to help 
us log the sought positions. Understanding the dimensions of our 
‘board’ paves the way for defining boundaries in our exploration mission. 
Now, how does one determine the size of a Python list?
The answer lies in Python's len() function.

def find_positions(board):
    positions = []
    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
    
Solution Building: Step 2
With our boundary map, we begin our expedition across the board. We use two nested for loops to do this, traversing the entire board one cell at a time.

def find_positions(board):
    positions = []
    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # ensuing exploration

Solution Building: Step 3
What's the plan for each cell, you ask? While exploring each cell, our trusty Python code inspects if the cell is empty.
If confirmed, it then peeks into the neighbors in the up, down, left, right directions.
If another vacant cell ('E') is spotted, we jot down the main cell's position in our result list.

def find_positions(board):
    positions = []
    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if board[i][j] == 'E':
                if ((i > 0 and board[i-1][j] == 'E') or 
                (i < rows - 1 and board[i+1][j] == 'E') or 
                (j > 0 and board[i][j-1] == 'E') or 
                (j < cols - 1 and board[i][j+1] == 'E')):
                    positions.append((i, j))
    return positions

board = [
 ['P', 'E', 'E', 'P'],
 ['E', 'P', 'E', 'P'],
 ['P', 'E', 'P', 'P'],
 ['P', 'E', 'P', 'E']
]

print(find_positions(board))

# Prints [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)]
