On a smaller game board, identify whether an element in a specific position has free space around, 
ensuring it is adjacent to at least one empty cell. Remember, adjacent cells are only the cells directly 
up, down, left, or right â€” not diagonally. 
Check only the neighboring cells, it doesn't matter if the current position is empty or it contains a piece.
